# Hackathon: Advanced Topics in Python
**QCBio Collaboratory**

Many of you who enjoyed the Collaboratory workshops have requested the opportunity to continue improving your computational skills beyond the workshop. We're pleased to announce a new event for those with interest in computational and quantitative methods in biology: a Hackathon dedicated to solving problems of interest to our community, using Python.

Our idea is to organize a Hackathon over a single day, and spend this day solving a couple of coding problems. To ensure that these problems are of relevance to a large number of people, we are asking for everyone interested to submit suggestions of problems that you, or colleagues, may want help tackling. This is a great opportunity to get help with a problem you're stuck on as we learn together how to overcome coding challenges. With a set of relevant problems, we can offer tailored assistance in advanced topics with Python, creating a stronger connection between the contents of our workshop and your research and going beyond the basic material provided by the current Collaboratory workshop. The hackathon is suitable for anyone who regularly uses or wishes to regularly use Python for their research, regardless of their level of expertise with programming. The only requirement is the Introduction to Python workshop.


This Hackathon will be hosted by the [QCBio Collaboratory](https://qcb.ucla.edu/collaboratory/).

## When? Where?

* Date: December 8th, 2017
* Where: Collaboratory Classroom (Boyer Hall 529),
Institute for Quantitative and Computational Biology, UCLA

## Registration and contact

To register, follow this link: [http://]()

To ensure that the problems used in the Hackathon are of relevance to a large number of people, during the registration we ask for suggestions of problems that you, or colleagues, may want help tackling. These suggestions can be anything, and you don't need to submit a solution, just a small description of the problem. Examples of types of problems: changing file format from one standard to another; automating a task or pipeline for many datasets; optimize the computation time of complex analyses and pipelines; applying basic methods of computer vision to segment images (e.g. for cell detection); building predictive models (e.g. using Machine Learning techniques); solving a model of ODEs to fit your data; etc.

## Coding problems

We will post here the list of problems soon. Stay tunned!

* [Parsing large number of files with Python](https://github.com/thmosqueiro/UCLA-Collaboratory_Hackathon/tree/master/Materials%20%26%20Resources/Problem%201) - Suppose you have a set of files with various names organized by folders and keywords encoded in the filenames. How can we set a script that parse these files and prepare them to perform analysis X?

## Who is this Hackathon intended for?

The hackathon is suitable for anyone who regularly uses or wishes to regularly use Python for their research, regardless of their level of expertise with programming. The only requirement is the Introduction to Python workshop.
